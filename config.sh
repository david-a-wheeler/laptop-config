# Prefix every host-secrets.sh-managed Keychain entry is stored under. This
# is what marks a secret as servable at all: secrets-server.py only ever
# looks up prefixed names, so "not found" already means "not servable";
# there's no separate list of allowed secret names to maintain here. Locking
# a secret to one VM is a further naming convention on top of this: see
# host-secrets.sh and architecture.md's Secrets Server section.

# git host -> logical secret name, space-separated "host:name" pairs.
# vm-git-helper.py (rendered from vm-git-helper.template.py) looks up the
# right secret name here for whatever git host it's asked to authenticate,
# then asks secrets-server.py for it by that short name (KEYCHAIN_PREFIX is
# applied host-side, never sent over the wire). Add an entry here (and run
# host-secrets.sh set <name> on the host) to bring another git host under
# the proxy; no script changes needed.
#
# Every secret name here (and every name secrets-client takes) is
# spelled like the environment variable it stands in for, e.g. "GH_TOKEN"
# rather than "github-pat": that's the same personal access token gh(1)
# reads from its own GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN environment variables (see
# "gh help environment"), so one Keychain entry backs both git's HTTPS
# auth (below) and gh's, with no separate token or config for gh to
# manage. gh's own "gh auth login" is deliberately never used: even with
# a system keyring available it leaves a long-lived credential resident
# in the VM (readable by any process in that login session, not just
# gh), which is exactly what this whole design keeps out of VMs.
# "gh-session" (a two-line wrapper over "secrets-client GH_TOKEN") gets
# the same token into a single child process's environment instead, the
# same ephemeral, human-approved pattern as everything else here.
#
# GH_PUBLIC_TOKEN (used by anon-access, not listed here since it's not a
# git host secret) is stored under the name "GH_PUBLIC_TOKEN!", not
# "GH_PUBLIC_TOKEN": a trailing "!" is what marks a Keychain entry as
# releasable without a human approval dialog (see secrets-server.template.py's
# _resolve() and host-secrets.sh); every secret defaults to requiring
# approval, so this only ever happens via a deliberate choice of name at
# "host-secrets.sh set" time, and "host-secrets.sh list" shows it directly.

# builds ~/.ssh/config Host blocks from that, so "ssh lftux"/"scp x lftux:"
# work directly; avahi's .local names don't resolve from the host, since
# mDNS doesn't cross UTM's Shared Network NAT (and bridging isn't an option
# on WiFi). Nothing here needs updating as VMs are added, removed, or
