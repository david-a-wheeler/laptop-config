"""macOS Host Secrets Server.

Listens on the virtual bridge interface, looks up a named secret in
Keychain, and prompts for human approval before releasing it. Serves any
secret host-secrets.sh has stored, not just a single GitHub PAT: the
caller (vm-git-helper or any other VM-side script) names which secret it
wants via "secret_name" in the request payload; for vm-git-helper, that
name is baked into a git config credential.<url>.helper line by
vm-setup.sh from config.sh's GIT_SECRETS, so git itself has already
picked it before vm-git-helper ever runs.

Rendered from secrets-server.template.py by host-setup.sh: edit the
template, not the installed copy, since a re-run of host-setup.sh
overwrites this file.

Only secrets stored under Keychain's "@@KEYCHAIN_PREFIX@@" prefix are ever
served (see get_secret_from_keychain()). This is the entire access-control
list: there's no separate allowlist to maintain, so adding a new servable
secret is just "host-secrets.sh set <name>" on the host, nothing else. A
request for a name that was never stored under the prefix looks exactly
like "not found": denied by construction, not by a check that could be
forgotten.

A secret can also be locked to one specific VM by storing it under
"<name>@<vm-hostname>" (still under the KEYCHAIN_PREFIX) instead of the
plain "<name>": see resolve_vm_hostname() and _resolve(). The VM's
identity is resolved from the request's real network source IP
cross-referenced against `utmctl ip-address`, the same source of truth
host-setup.sh already uses for ~/.ssh/config, so no separate credential is
distributed to VMs to identify themselves.

Separately, a secret can be marked as releasable without a human
approval dialog by storing it under "<name>!" instead of "<name>" (the
two compose: "<name>@<vm-hostname>!" is both locked and dialog-free);
see needs_confirmation() and _resolve(). Every secret defaults to
requiring approval, so this only ever happens by deliberately choosing
that name at `host-secrets.sh set` time, and `host-secrets.sh list`
shows it directly, with nothing else to keep in sync. Only ever use this
for a secret that leaking does meaningfully no more harm than having no
secret at all (see GH_PUBLIC_TOKEN in rotate-github-pat.sh).

Logs one JSON object per line to stdout (see log_event) for every request
this handles, approved/denied/errored, not just crashes. This exists
because of a real incident: the process was alive and correctly bound (the
actual cause turned out to be the VM's own egress firewall missing a rule
for this port; see nftables.template.conf), but the LaunchAgent's log
files sat empty the whole time regardless, which wasted real time
diagnosing "is it even receiving requests." Now every request leaves a
line, flushed immediately, whether or not anything goes wrong.

To test connectivity or the approval dialog itself without ever touching
the real secret, set "dry_run": true in a /secret request; see
_handle_secret_dry_run. This exists because of a second incident on the
same day: a raw curl test against a real request printed an actual token
in plaintext. dry_run makes that a non-issue by construction, not by
remembering to redact output: the server never reads the secret's value
out of Keychain at all when dry_run is set, so there's nothing to expose
regardless of how the response gets displayed.
