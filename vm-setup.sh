# phase. curl has to land here, before anything else (the gh repo setup
# right below, the Claude Code installer further down) tries to use it,
# and a fresh VM image can't be assumed to have it already. Node.js/npm are
# deliberately NOT installed here: Claude Code's native installer (below)
# is self-contained. qemu-guest-agent lets the host ask UTM's utmctl for
# this VM's current IP (see host-setup.sh); without it running here,
# "ssh <this-vm-name>" from the host has nothing to go on.

# git/shellcheck/make/build-essential/vim/python3: general-purpose dev
# tools worth having on every VM regardless of project (vim in particular
# because EDITOR/VISUAL below are set to it; python3 because
# secrets-client (which vm-git-helper below shells out to on every git
# push/fetch) is a Python script, so it's a hard requirement for the
# git-auth bridge, not just a nicety; it's not worth assuming it's
# preinstalled). jq is here for the same reason:
# rotate-heroku-key.sh's revoke-the-old-authorization step filters
# "heroku authorizations -j" through it. Checked against `apt-mark
# showmanual` on lftux and deliberately left out anything project-specific
# rather than universal: ruby, postgresql, and the heroku CLI are for one
# project (BadgeApp) and don't belong in a generic laptop-config repo;
# cmake, autoconf, bison, pkg-config, and the lib*-dev packages are
# ruby-build's prerequisites for compiling Ruby, same story; graphviz
# looked like it might be a project's doc-generation dependency rather
# than a general tool. Add project-specific packages by hand in that
# project's own setup, not here. "apt-get install -y" is naturally
# idempotent (a no-op once everything's already at the latest version), so
# this one line covers first install and every later re-run.

# nono further down, this one has a real repo behind it, so it's safe to
# automate. Deliberately NOT gated behind "is gh already installed": these
# are just idempotent file writes, and doing them unconditionally means a
# corrupted keyring/repo file or a key rotation gets fixed on the next run
# too, not just on first install. curl writes to a temp file first (rather
# than piping into "sudo tee") so a failed download is caught here via
# set -e, instead of silently producing an empty keyring that only fails
# later, confusingly, inside apt-get update. This needs its own apt-get
# update (the one above ran before this repo existed), so gh install is
